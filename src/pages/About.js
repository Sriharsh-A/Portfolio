              <p>
                I’m <strong>Sriharsh Akkala</strong>, a 20-year-old founder, developer, and visual creator driven by
                the idea that creativity works best when disciplines collide.
              </p>
              <p>
                At 20, I founded a fashion brand, translating emotion, identity, and storytelling into wearable design.
                At the same time, I build web applications where logic meets experience
                writing code not just to function, but to feel right.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond code and clothing, I work through photography and graphic design,
                using visuals as a language to capture mood, movement, and meaning.
                <strong>
                  Whether I’m designing a streetwear drop, developing a React app, or framing a shot,
                  my focus stays the same: clarity, impact, and authenticity.
                </strong>
                I don’t believe in choosing between art and engineering.
                I build at the intersection where ideas turn real, and concepts turn tangible.
              </p>
